    <p>R package <code>fstcore</code> contains R bindings to the C++ <code>fstlib</code> library which allows interfacing with <em>fst</em> files.

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>The fstcore package is based on six C++ libraries or components:</p><ul><li><p><strong>fstlib</strong>: library containing code to write, read and compute on files stored in the <em>fst</em> format.
Written and owned by Mark Klik.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LZ4</strong>: library containing code to compress data with the LZ4 compressor. Written and owned
by Yann Collet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ZSTD</strong>: library containing code to compress data with the ZSTD compressor. Written by
Yann Collet and owned by Facebook, Inc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>libdivsufsort-lite</strong>: a  lightweight suffix array construction algorithm. This code is bundled with
the ZSTD compression library. Written and owned by Yuta Mori.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sources from zstdmt</strong>: a multithreading library for Brotli, Lizard, LZ4, LZ5 and Zstandard.  This code is
bundled with the ZSTD library. Written and owned by Tino Reichardt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>source file zstd_opt.h</strong>: Price functions for optimal parser. Written and owned by Yann Collet and Przemyslaw
Skibinski. This code is bundled with the ZSTD library.</p></li>
